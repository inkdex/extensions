## Development Contributions

### Repository Structure

The project is organized across multiple repositories, based on the type and theme of the extensions:

- **Content Extensions:** Split into multiple repositories based on the theme of the target websites:

    - Extensions for websites with **generic themes** are grouped into [theme-specific repositories][generic-theme-repositories].

    - Extensions for websites with **non-generic or custom themes** are grouped together into [a single repository][general-extensions-repository].

- **Tracker Extensions:** [A dedicated repository][tracker-extensions-repository] for extensions that integrate with progress tracking services.

This modular structure keeps repositories focused, maintainable, and easier to contribute to. Always ensure you're working in the appropriate repository before making changes.

### Project Conventions

- **Layout:** Each repository follows a shared layout defined in the [template repository][template-repository]. To propose layout changes, open an issue or pull request in that repository.

- **Versioning:** We use [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][semver-2.0.0] for extension versioning.

- **Branch Naming:** Branches should follow the [semantic branch naming][semantic-branch-names] convention.

- **Commit Messages:** Use [semantic commit messages][semantic-commit-messages] to keep the commit history clear and consistent.

- **Pull Requests:** Large pull requests that include multiple grouped changes must include a detailed description and any related issue or pull request links.

### Development Workflow

#### Running Scripts

Each repository includes useful development scripts. Refer to the `scripts` section in its `package.json` file to see whatâ€™s available (e.g., testing, bundling, formatting).

#### Creating a New Extension

1. Fork and clone the appropriate repository.
2. Run `npm install` (requires [Node.js][node.js] and npm).
3. Add your extension code to the `src` directory.
4. Run `npm test` and ensure all tests pass.
5. Commit and push your changes.
6. Open a pull request and contact a maintainer.
